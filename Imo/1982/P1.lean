The function $f(n)$ is defined on the positive integers and takes non-negative integer values. $f(2)=0,f(3)>0,f(9999)=3333$ and for all $m,n$: $f(m+n)-f(m)-f(n)=0$ or $1$. Determine $f(1982)$. -/

    (h₀ : ∀ m n, 0 < m ∧ 0 < n → (f (m + n) - f m - f n : ℤ) = 0 ∨ (f (m + n) - f m - f n : ℤ) = 1)
    (h₁ : f 2 = 0) (h₂ : 0 < f 3) (h₃ : f 9999 = 3333) : f 1982 = answer(660) := by
  sorry
